## Setup project structure and dependencies

- Created package.json with Vite, TypeScript, and Vitest dependencies
- Created tsconfig.json with strict TypeScript settings for ES2020 bundler mode
- Created vite.config.ts with build and dev server configuration
- Restructured project:
  - index.html moved to root (Vite convention)
  - src/main.ts as the TypeScript entry point
  - src/style.css extracted from POC
  - src/types.ts with Service and Connection type definitions
  - src/data/services.ts with typed service and connection data
- Added src/data/services.test.ts with Vitest tests for data integrity
- Updated .gitignore to include dist/
- All tests passing (7 tests)
- Build produces production-ready output in dist/

## Initial implementation of network visualization using canvas element

- Created src/canvas/CanvasRenderer.ts - a modular canvas rendering class that handles:
  - Drawing AWS service nodes with category-specific gradient colors
  - Drawing connection lines between related services
  - Mouse-based pan (drag) and zoom (wheel) navigation
  - Zoom towards mouse position for intuitive zooming
  - Hit detection for clicking on service nodes
  - Hover state detection with cursor changes
  - Selection state highlighting
  - HiDPI/Retina display support via devicePixelRatio
- Updated src/main.ts to use CanvasRenderer instead of DOM-based rendering
- Updated index.html to use a canvas element instead of a div
- Simplified src/style.css by removing DOM node/connection styles (now drawn on canvas)
- Added comprehensive tests in src/canvas/CanvasRenderer.test.ts:
  - Tests for initialization and state management
  - Tests for view reset and focus on service
  - Tests for render method (context calls verification)
  - Tests for service click callbacks
  - Tests for error handling (null context)
- Added happy-dom as dev dependency for DOM testing environment
- Updated vite.config.ts with happy-dom test environment
- All tests passing (24 tests: 7 data + 17 canvas)

## Ensure canvas navigation works as expected

- Fixed drag/click conflict by tracking total drag distance and using a 5px threshold to distinguish clicks from drags
- Added touch event support for mobile devices:
  - Single-finger pan (drag to move the view)
  - Two-finger pinch-to-zoom with zoom toward pinch center
  - Tap-to-select services on touch devices
- Added keyboard navigation for accessibility:
  - Arrow keys for panning (50px per keypress)
  - +/- keys for zooming in/out
  - 0 key to reset view (center on content)
  - Escape key to deselect current service
  - Canvas is now focusable (tabindex="0")
- Added automatic view centering on content:
  - Initial view centers and scales to fit all services with padding
  - Reset view now centers on content instead of returning to (0,0)
  - New public `centerViewOnContent()` method calculates bounding box and fits view
- Updated tests in src/canvas/CanvasRenderer.test.ts:
  - Added tests for touch event listener setup
  - Added tests for keyboard event listener setup
  - Added tests for keyboard navigation (all arrow keys, zoom keys, reset, escape)
  - Added tests for centerViewOnContent behavior
  - Updated existing tests to account for auto-centered initial state
- All tests passing (36 tests: 7 data + 29 canvas)
