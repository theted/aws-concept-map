## Setup project structure and dependencies

- Created package.json with Vite, TypeScript, and Vitest dependencies
- Created tsconfig.json with strict TypeScript settings for ES2020 bundler mode
- Created vite.config.ts with build and dev server configuration
- Restructured project:
  - index.html moved to root (Vite convention)
  - src/main.ts as the TypeScript entry point
  - src/style.css extracted from POC
  - src/types.ts with Service and Connection type definitions
  - src/data/services.ts with typed service and connection data
- Added src/data/services.test.ts with Vitest tests for data integrity
- Updated .gitignore to include dist/
- All tests passing (7 tests)
- Build produces production-ready output in dist/
