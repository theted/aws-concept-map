## Setup project structure and dependencies

- Created package.json with Vite, TypeScript, and Vitest dependencies
- Created tsconfig.json with strict TypeScript settings for ES2020 bundler mode
- Created vite.config.ts with build and dev server configuration
- Restructured project:
  - index.html moved to root (Vite convention)
  - src/main.ts as the TypeScript entry point
  - src/style.css extracted from POC
  - src/types.ts with Service and Connection type definitions
  - src/data/services.ts with typed service and connection data
- Added src/data/services.test.ts with Vitest tests for data integrity
- Updated .gitignore to include dist/
- All tests passing (7 tests)
- Build produces production-ready output in dist/

## Initial implementation of network visualization using canvas element

- Created src/canvas/CanvasRenderer.ts - a modular canvas rendering class that handles:
  - Drawing AWS service nodes with category-specific gradient colors
  - Drawing connection lines between related services
  - Mouse-based pan (drag) and zoom (wheel) navigation
  - Zoom towards mouse position for intuitive zooming
  - Hit detection for clicking on service nodes
  - Hover state detection with cursor changes
  - Selection state highlighting
  - HiDPI/Retina display support via devicePixelRatio
- Updated src/main.ts to use CanvasRenderer instead of DOM-based rendering
- Updated index.html to use a canvas element instead of a div
- Simplified src/style.css by removing DOM node/connection styles (now drawn on canvas)
- Added comprehensive tests in src/canvas/CanvasRenderer.test.ts:
  - Tests for initialization and state management
  - Tests for view reset and focus on service
  - Tests for render method (context calls verification)
  - Tests for service click callbacks
  - Tests for error handling (null context)
- Added happy-dom as dev dependency for DOM testing environment
- Updated vite.config.ts with happy-dom test environment
- All tests passing (24 tests: 7 data + 17 canvas)
