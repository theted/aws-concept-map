## Setup project structure and dependencies

- Created package.json with Vite, TypeScript, and Vitest dependencies
- Created tsconfig.json with strict TypeScript settings for ES2020 bundler mode
- Created vite.config.ts with build and dev server configuration
- Restructured project:
  - index.html moved to root (Vite convention)
  - src/main.ts as the TypeScript entry point
  - src/style.css extracted from POC
  - src/types.ts with Service and Connection type definitions
  - src/data/services.ts with typed service and connection data
- Added src/data/services.test.ts with Vitest tests for data integrity
- Updated .gitignore to include dist/
- All tests passing (7 tests)
- Build produces production-ready output in dist/

## Initial implementation of network visualization using canvas element

- Created src/canvas/CanvasRenderer.ts - a modular canvas rendering class that handles:
  - Drawing AWS service nodes with category-specific gradient colors
  - Drawing connection lines between related services
  - Mouse-based pan (drag) and zoom (wheel) navigation
  - Zoom towards mouse position for intuitive zooming
  - Hit detection for clicking on service nodes
  - Hover state detection with cursor changes
  - Selection state highlighting
  - HiDPI/Retina display support via devicePixelRatio
- Updated src/main.ts to use CanvasRenderer instead of DOM-based rendering
- Updated index.html to use a canvas element instead of a div
- Simplified src/style.css by removing DOM node/connection styles (now drawn on canvas)
- Added comprehensive tests in src/canvas/CanvasRenderer.test.ts:
  - Tests for initialization and state management
  - Tests for view reset and focus on service
  - Tests for render method (context calls verification)
  - Tests for service click callbacks
  - Tests for error handling (null context)
- Added happy-dom as dev dependency for DOM testing environment
- Updated vite.config.ts with happy-dom test environment
- All tests passing (24 tests: 7 data + 17 canvas)

## Ensure canvas navigation works as expected

- Fixed drag/click conflict by tracking total drag distance and using a 5px threshold to distinguish clicks from drags
- Added touch event support for mobile devices:
  - Single-finger pan (drag to move the view)
  - Two-finger pinch-to-zoom with zoom toward pinch center
  - Tap-to-select services on touch devices
- Added keyboard navigation for accessibility:
  - Arrow keys for panning (50px per keypress)
  - +/- keys for zooming in/out
  - 0 key to reset view (center on content)
  - Escape key to deselect current service
  - Canvas is now focusable (tabindex="0")
- Added automatic view centering on content:
  - Initial view centers and scales to fit all services with padding
  - Reset view now centers on content instead of returning to (0,0)
  - New public `centerViewOnContent()` method calculates bounding box and fits view
- Updated tests in src/canvas/CanvasRenderer.test.ts:
  - Added tests for touch event listener setup
  - Added tests for keyboard event listener setup
  - Added tests for keyboard navigation (all arrow keys, zoom keys, reset, escape)
  - Added tests for centerViewOnContent behavior
  - Updated existing tests to account for auto-centered initial state
- All tests passing (36 tests: 7 data + 29 canvas)

## Add support for showing detailed descriptions of services when clicked

- Created src/ui/InfoPanel.ts - a modular info panel component that handles:
  - Displaying service details (name, category, description, details, key points)
  - Close button with proper event handling
  - XSS protection via HTML escaping for all user-provided content
  - Show/hide functionality with CSS class toggling
  - Callback support for close events
- Updated src/main.ts to use the new InfoPanel class:
  - Refactored from inline DOM manipulation to modular component
  - Integrated close callback with canvas renderer for proper state sync
- Enhanced src/style.css with close button styling:
  - Positioned absolutely in top-right corner
  - Hover effects with color transitions
  - Proper padding on h2 to avoid overlap
- Added comprehensive tests in src/ui/InfoPanel.test.ts:
  - Tests for initialization and visibility state
  - Tests for show/hide functionality
  - Tests for service content rendering (name, category, description, details, key points)
  - Tests for close button behavior and callback
  - Tests for XSS protection (HTML escaping verification)
  - Tests for service switching
- All tests passing (56 tests: 7 data + 29 canvas + 20 info panel)

## Move content to JSON files

- Created src/data/services.json containing all AWS service data:
  - 34 services with name, category, description, details, keyPoints, and x/y coordinates
  - Structured for easy editing by non-developers
- Created src/data/connections.json containing all service relationships:
  - 45 connections as [from, to] tuples
  - Maintains the same graph structure as before
- Refactored src/data/services.ts to import from JSON files:
  - Uses Vite's native JSON import support
  - Type assertions ensure proper TypeScript types (ServiceMap, Connection[])
  - Clean separation of content (JSON) from code (TypeScript)
- All existing tests continue to pass (56 tests) verifying data integrity

## Add content for additional services

- Expanded services.json from 34 to 55 AWS services (+21 new services)
- Added new "devtools" category for CI/CD services with blue gradient color
- New services added with full descriptions and key points:
  - Compute/Serverless: API Gateway, Step Functions, EKS
  - Security: Cognito, Secrets Manager, WAF, Shield, GuardDuty, Inspector
  - DevTools: CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy
  - Database: ElastiCache, Redshift, Athena
  - Messaging: EventBridge, Kinesis
  - Networking: NAT Gateway, Direct Connect, VPN Gateway
  - Management: X-Ray
  - Storage: Storage Gateway, Snow Family
- Expanded connections.json from 45 to 106 connections (+61 new connections)
- All services include certification-relevant key points for:
  - AWS Cloud Practitioner
  - AWS Solutions Architect Associate
  - AWS Developer Associate
- Updated src/types.ts to include new 'devtools' category
- Updated src/canvas/CanvasRenderer.ts with devtools category color
- Updated src/data/services.test.ts to validate new category
- All tests passing (56 tests)

## Add extra description for each service with Learn More button

- Updated src/types.ts with new optional fields:
  - Added Resource interface with title and url properties
  - Added extendedDescription (optional string) to Service interface
  - Added resources (optional Resource[]) to Service interface
- Updated src/data/services.json with extended content for 7 key services:
  - EC2, Lambda, S3, VPC, IAM, RDS, DynamoDB
  - Each includes detailed extendedDescription with certification-relevant information
  - Each includes 3 resource links (Documentation, Best Practices/Pricing/Features)
- Enhanced src/ui/InfoPanel.ts with Learn More functionality:
  - Added isExpanded state to track toggle state
  - Added isExtendedContentVisible() public method for testing
  - Added toggleExpanded() public method to toggle state
  - Added hasExtendedContent() private method to check for extended content
  - Updated render() to show "Learn more" / "Show less" button when extended content exists
  - Extended content section shows extendedDescription and resources when expanded
  - Resources rendered as links with target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer"
  - Button has aria-expanded attribute for accessibility
  - All content properly escaped for XSS protection

  - .learn-more-btn with gradient background and hover effects
  - .extended-content container with top border separator
  - .extended-description section styling
  - .resources section with styled links and external link indicator (↗)
- Added comprehensive tests in src/ui/InfoPanel.test.ts:
  - Tests for Learn More button visibility based on extended content
  - Tests for expand/collapse toggle behavior
  - Tests for aria-expanded accessibility attribute
  - Tests for extended description rendering
  - Tests for resources links rendering with correct attributes
  - Tests for showing only description or only resources
  - Tests for state reset when switching services or hiding panel
  - Tests for XSS protection in extended content
- All tests passing (73 tests: 7 data + 29 canvas + 37 info panel)
